# ConverType Chrome Extension - convert where ever you are...

The ConverType Chrome Extension gives you nearly all features the original website has in a single chrome extension. Due to the small screen space this extension takes, you can do other things in the process of converting values. 

Are you currently streaming a video? You're from europe and somebody said ```70° Fahrenheit```. What do you do now?
You open the ConverType Chrome Extension and convert 70° Fahren to Celcius while you are watching the video. 
Is'nt that great?
